# MultiSigWallet

## Overview
The MultiSigWallet contract is a smart contract written in Solidity that enables multi-signature management of Ethereum transactions. It allows multiple owners to authorize transactions, enhancing security for fund management.

## Features
- **Multi-owner Support**: Multiple addresses can be designated as owners.
- **Transaction Submission**: Owners can submit transactions to be approved.
- **Confirmation Mechanism**: Transactions require a specified number of confirmations before execution.
- **Safe Execution**: Only confirmed transactions can transfer funds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Solidity**: Ensure you have a Solidity environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat) set up for testing and deployment.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiSigWallet.git
   cd MultiSigWallet
   ```

2. Open the `MultiSigWallet.sol` file in your Solidity IDE.

### Usage
1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Initialize the contract with the owners' addresses and the required number of confirmations.
   ```solidity
   MultiSigWallet wallet = new MultiSigWallet([owner1, owner2, owner3], 2);
   ```

2. **Submit a Transaction**:
   - Owners can submit a transaction by calling the `submitTransaction` function.
   ```solidity
   wallet.submitTransaction(recipientAddress, amount);
   ```

3. **Confirm a Transaction**:
   - Owners can confirm a submitted transaction.
   ```solidity
   wallet.confirmTransaction(transactionId);
   ```

4. **Execute a Transaction**:
   - Once enough confirmations are received, the transaction will be executed automatically.
